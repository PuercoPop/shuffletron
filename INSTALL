To install a binary release:

   make install

Ideally, install rlwrap (http://utopia.knoware.nl/~hlub/rlwrap/) as
well. In Debian Linux, this is provided by the rlwrap package.

Binary releases are compiled with SBCL.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

To compile from source:

Compiling Shuffletron from source requires the following:
        SBCL
        CFFI
        Osicat (at least version 0.6.0)
        Mixalot (at least version 0.0.2)

Run 'make', then 'sudo make install'.

The default make target compiles the program using SBCL. If you prefer
CCL, type 'make shuffletron-ccl' or 'make shuffletron-ccl64' instead
(see "Support for Clozure Common Lisp" below).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Support for Clozure Common Lisp:

Due to a bug in CCL version 1.3 converning save-application, binaries
compiled with this version of CCL will not work. Shuffletron can
instead be used with this version of CCL by invoking lisp as follows:

  ccl -n -l load-ccl.lisp
or
  ccl64 -n -l load-ccl.lisp

In SVN versions of CCL later than 04/29/09, binaries compiled with the
shuffletron-ccl and shuffletron-ccl64 make targets should work perfectly.  
Note that the "shuffletron" wrapper script and the install target still
assume the binary is named "shuffletron-bin". In order to install a
version built with CCL, you'll have to rename the compiled executable to
"shuffletron-bin".
