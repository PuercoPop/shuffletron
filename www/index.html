<h1>Shuffletron</h1>

<p>Shuffletron is a music player for Linux. It runs in the terminal, with a textual interface, and has support for search, labelling files using arbitrary tags, and a queue. It is designed to let me spend more time playing music and less time clicking around a GUI - the tagging features help me make note of interesting songs I've overlooked while shuffling through my whole library, and the search features allow me to quickly find specific songs I want to hear. It starts up quickly and copes well with large music libraries (tens of thousands of files). It is written in <a href="http://cliki.net">Common Lisp</a> (but don't let that put you off). For audio, MP3 playback, and ID3 parsing, it uses my <a href="http://vintage-digital.com/hefner/software/mixalot/mixalot.html">Mixalot</a> suite of libraries. Here's what it looks like in action:</p>

<p>The current version of Shuffletron is 0.0.2. It requires <a href="http://www.mpg123.de/api/">libmpg123</a> (most Linux desktops already have this), and installing the program <a href="http://utopia.knoware.nl/~hlub/rlwrap/">rlwrap</a> is strongly recommended.</p> 

<p>Binary releases are available for the following platforms:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Shuffletron for Linux / x86 (32-bit): <a href="release/shuffletron-current-linux-x86.tar.gz">download</a></li>
  <li>Shuffletron for Linux / x86_64 (64-bit): <a href="release/shuffletron-current-linux-x86_64.tar.gz">download</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Compiling from source requires <a href="http://sbcl.org">SBCL</a> or a recent version of the <a href="http://trac.clozure.com/openmcl">Clozure CL</a> compiler (SBCL is recommended). Compiling a binary follows the standard 'make' / 'make install' process (atypical for lisp programs) and uses the implementation's respective application delivery support to produce an executable. Clozure CL users may have to edit <tt>build-ccl.lisp</tt> to tweak the ASDF search path.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Shuffletron version 0.0.2 (current version): <a href="release/shuffletron-0.0.2.tar.gz">download</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The code is released under an MIT-style license.</p>
